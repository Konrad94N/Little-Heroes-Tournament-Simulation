# Little-Terminal-Heroes-Tournament-Simulation
Just a simple Terminal Simulation

The game is just a very simple simulation of a Tournament that I did just for fun.

If You wan't to play - feel free to download and try. File contains enything that's needed, including '.sh' and '.bat' files to start a game. Just follow the instructions as I didn't implement any bug-handling in case of wrong input from players side (although there is not much of it so it shouldn't be that irritating).

HOPE YOU HAVE FUN!
