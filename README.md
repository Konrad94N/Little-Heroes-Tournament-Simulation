# Little-Heroes-Tournament-Simulation
Just a Simulation in two versions: Terminal and wrapped in GUI, both written in pure JAVA. 
GUI though still needs a lot of work, aspecially when it comes to multi-threading to make it enjoyable a bit more. Nevertheless You might be interested to take a look at the code, so I am publishing it as well. I will most likely develop GUI version in the future and republish new versions.

The game is just a very simple simulation of a Tournament that I did for fun.

If You want to play - feel free to download and try. File contains enything that's needed, including '.sh' and '.bat' files to start a game. Just follow the instructions as I didn't implement any bug-handling in case of wrong input from players side (although there is not much of it so it shouldn't be that irritating).

HOPE YOU HAVE FUN!
