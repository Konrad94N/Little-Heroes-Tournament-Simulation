# Little-Heroes-Tournament-Simulation
Just a Simulation in two versions: Terminal and wrapped in GUI, both written in pure JAVA. 
I managed to develop GUI version enough to make it at least a little bit of fun. It still needs some work, however I am sure You might spend some nice time with it already.

The game is just a very simple simulation of a Tournament that I did for fun.

If You want to play - feel free to download and try. File contains anything that's needed, including '.sh' and '.bat' files to start a game. Just follow the instructions as I didn't implement any bug-handling in case of wrong input from players side in Terminal version (although there is not much of it so it shouldn't be that irritating).

HOPE YOU HAVE FUN!
